                My first discord bot.
                In fact, it was not only mine, but also my partener's.
                I met a person who was also interested in discord bots, and decided to make together.
                But soon he quitted, and it became mine.
                I don't have the all versions of source since I didn't use github until I deleted the bot file by accident.
                At that time, I didn't know much about discord.py and python
                - maybe I used 1.4.x - so all the source was in 'bot.py'.
                The first of Studio Orora - (formerly Team Orora) - was also related with this.
                Service discontinued in the middle of 2020 Dec due to hacking by China Network
                - I don't know exactly who China Network's members were.

                Team Orora, which was Team ThinkingBot at first, was established on late 2020 - I don't remember exactly.
                It was foolish of me at then to make a team, not having enough skill in developing and leading.
                There are two theories about how the name, "Orora", was made.
                The first one is that an user, Happytree Samsung, - now manager - made from a word I often used to use, '오호라'.
                The second one is that I quoted 'Aurora' - not common, but unique -
                and I changed 'Au' to 'O', to emphasize the meaning of uniqueness.
                I guess the first one is true, but second one is quite plausible to me.
                Soon, the name was changed to 'Studio Orora' - it's not accurate if I did.
                But along the discontinuation of ThinkingBot, the team was also dissolved in 2021 Jan 5.

                After ThinkingBot ended, I made another bot in 2021 Mar, named Finix.
                As I learned so many things in discord.py such as cogs, the code of Finix became much better than ThinkingBot.
                I have no idea why I did this, but I changed its name to 'ThinkingBot-v2'.
                It had much more functions than original, such as fully random simple stock sim or mathematics calculations.
                When the bot was discontinued, I was developing music function
                - the hardest to make in discord without connecting with other service such as discord OAuth2 verification.

                The most successful bot I've ever made.
                I used to have a personal server, where I wrote memoes and uploaded captures and only I can see.
                While I was developing ThinkingBot-v2, I wrote many ideas in there, and Meme Bot is the one of them.
                It was released in late 2021 Jun 12(approximately). On 2021 Sep 23, it became the bot of Studio Orora,
                which I and jin^^*~ - one of my friend - owned.
                It quickly reached 75 guilds, which made Discord Verification Team to reject my verification application
                for the reason that the bot grew too quickly - I'm serious, this is real reason.
                Finally, making another bot account of memebot to apply verification again
                - if you're rejected, you can't apply again on the same bot account - ,
                on 2021 Nov 2, I quitted developing this, and Happytree Samsung,
                who turned the code from message commands to slash commands, became the manager.
                Soon, it reached 75 guilds - it took longer than before - and got verified successfully.
                Now it's in about 140 guilds.<br><br>

                Studio Orora is my second team, inheriting Team Orora.
                The history of Studio Orora is devided into two parts.
                The first part is from 2021 Feb to about 2021 May~Jun - no record :(.
                It was a developers' team which made not only a discord bot, but also desktop application - CloudShare.
                But as the project didn't get a good reaction, the team was soon dissolved.
                To talk about the second part, it was established by the merge of
                INFINITY bot project and Meme Bot project in 2021 Sep, to get more fame and make them developed more quickly
                - that means more people would take part in development.
                The first owners were of course me and jin^^*~.
                But we quitted manager work individually - as I tried to quit Discord
                and he thought it would be better to make another person do the manger work instead he does.
                Due to this, now Happytree Samsung is the manager.
