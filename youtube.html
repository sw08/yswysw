            <h3>The reason I started this<br><br></h3>
            <p>I've operated this channel since 2022/3/8.
            The reason I began this is just that I had nothing to use my free time - that made me so boring -
            and I thought it was a kind of things I should have done at least once. Now, it became one of the most important things to me.

            <h3>How the videos and channel have changed<br><br></h3>
            <p>
                At first, I started uploading my gameplay videos without editing. But soon I started this,
                finding VSDC Video Editor - I had no money to buy premier pro or etc
                - which works pretty good on my old laptop. <span style="opacity: 0.25;">It's not a advertisement!</span>
                The editing quality has upgraded gradually, but due to the gpu of my laptop (Radeon Vega 6 Graphics - cpu built-in),
                the video resolution hasn't been good;that's a quite sad thing, isn't it? 
            </p><br><br>

                My channel name was 'yswysw', my initial at first.
                Someone may tell me my initial should be 'lsw', not 'ysw'.
                This is just because my father had me to do - I don't remember the reasons - and it's just the reason.
                <span style="opacity: 0.25">Also I liked 'ysw' more then 'lsw'.</span>
                As you can see, I'm a Korean youtuber, which means my channel name would be easier to remember if it's Korean, not English.
                In conclusion, I changed my channel name from 'yswysw' to '잡다한 영상공작소', which has been used so far.

            <h3>The contents uploaded on the channel<br><br></h3>
            <p>
                The main contents on this channel was Euro Truck Simulator 2(ETS2).
                Then was the time I was losing interest on ETS2, as I was not enjoying.
                So, I bought a game - Assetto Corsa, which is my second main contents.
                So far, I used to upload this two contents, and sometimes funny shorts in my life.
                On July 15, I decided to upload other contents, as I thought many people aren't interested in my contents.
                The conclusion of this is my Fall Guys video.
